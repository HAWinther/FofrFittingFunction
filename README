This folder contains the fitting formula implemented in different languages.

The folder [CAMB\_Files] contains the modified CAMB files + description of the modifications needed.
The folder [camb\_with\_fitting\_formula] contains a complete (the latest) version of CAMB with the modifications.
Just add [fofr0] to the parameter-file and run with do\_nonlinear > 0 and get\_transfer = T to get output matter P(k,z) files where the fitting formula have been applies. If [fofr0] is missing from the parameter-file or put to 0.0 then it's normal CAMB.
